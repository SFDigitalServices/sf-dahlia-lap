Applicants should inquire with the building contact person listed above to determine if the building has a minimum number of years that it must remain a rental building.  (Some buildings may have such restrictions based on government sources of financing for their building.) Most buildings may have no restrictions on conversion at all. <br> <br>It is also important to note that units governed by the Inclusionary Housing Program are NOT governed by the San Francisco Rent Ordinance (also known as “rent control”). Among other rules, rents may increase beyond increases allowed under “rent control.”  Please see the <a href=\"http://sf-moh.org/index.aspx?page=295\" target=\"_blank\">Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program Monitoring and Procedures Manual 2013</a> for more information.",
